<h2>EDGELESS, European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme. - 101092950</h2>
<p>Role: Research Associate <br> </p>
<p>University of Cambridge <br> </p>
<p>(Feb 2024 - Present) 
EDGELESS project aims to leverage the serverless concept in all the layers in the edge-cloud continuum to fully benefit from diverse and decentralised computational resources available on-demand close to where data are produced or consumed. In particular,
we aim at realising an efficient and transparent horizontal pooling of the resources on edge nodes with constrained capabilities or specialised hardware,
smoothly integrated with cloud resources, which is a giant leap forward compared to state-of-the-art vertical offloading solutions where the edge is a mere supplement of the cloud.

<h2>Smart Manufacturing Data Hub, Innovate UK, £50 million</h2>
<p>Role: Research Associate <br> </p>
<p>(Nov 2022- Feb 2024) 
The £50 million Smart Manufacturing Data Hub (SMDH) will support small and medium size manufacturers to capture and better utilise their data, 
helping them increase productivity, growth and sustainability. Businesses in sectors spanning from food and drink, aerospace and many more will be supported to develop, 
test and adopt the latest data-driven technologies.
Nearly 10,000 manufacturers are expected to benefit from the hub and 13,000 jobs will be supported, helping to boost economic growth and level-up regions across the UK. 
The hub will be supported by £20 million from the UK government backed Made Smarter Innovation Programme, along with £30 million of business co-investment.

<h2>Serverless Edge Computing for 5G Edge Devices, Innovate UK, £499,223</h2>
<p>Role: Research Associate （Lead）<br> </p>
    Edge devices require high-quality internet connections as alerts/detections need to be processed in real-time to enable effective action to minimise the impact of health&safety issues. 
    On construction sites and other industrial environments, the lack of reliable connectivity is the main barrier to adoption. Construction firms also need to ensure that personal data is protected.
    Existing cloud-based solutions for edge computing require complex set-up and configuration, create potential data security issues, and are not dynamic enough to facilitate real-time data processing and achieve required latency(5ms).
    EMS and Loughborough University are developing a novel serverless edge FaaS (Function as a Service) engine(ServerlessEdge) to optimise existing i-MO routers to enable connected edge devices to operate onsite in real-time in traditionally low connectivity environments without the need to deploy and support additional on-site IT infrastructure or centralised services.

<h2>Intelligent Edge of Things, Innovate UK, £972,750</h2>
<p>Role: Research Assistant （Lead）<br> </p>
<p>(Nov 2021-2022 June) This project takes the concept of edge computing to a new level by introducing the third, local, tier in addition to
the data centre and edge computing tiers. We utilise Artificial Intelligence to unleash the full potential of each
Edge architectural tier to meet different application requirements. This project focuses on developing an intelligent
three-tier Edge IoT architecture for enabling novel services around business areas such as smart transportation,
Industry 4.0 and entertainment. We incorporate VPN and Kubernetes to build an edge computing platform across multiple networks.
Computing resources, located in different network providers' domains, are efficiently federated and hence brings a variety of opportunities in the sense of
edge clouds federation. This project is sponsored by Innovate UK.
